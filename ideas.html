       Campaigns are always looking for cost-effective ways to
       influence voters, as well as raise more capital.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><u>Idea:</u>
      <ul><li>
        <em>For campaigns to ask their supporters to share emotional videos or statistics
        on their social media accounts. </em> For example, Mayor Buttigieg would
        ask his supporters
        to share an Instagram video of him standing up for immigrants. From my research and experience, this strategy occurs
        today, except the ask only comes in a tweet or Facebook post. By having the
        the ask done over email or text, more people will get exposed to the content.
        In turn, those who share the social media content requested by the campaign
        could not only influence their friends, but might also be more likely to contribute
        money to the campaign. In essence, campaigns would now be
        asking supporters to spend their social capital, i.e. sharing posts on social media
        supportive of the cause, instead of
        their physical capital.
      </li></ul>

    <li><u>Statistics:</u>
      <ul><li> 92% of people say they trust "earned media", e.g. recommendations from
        friends, more than any other kind of media (Nielsen)</li>
        <li> 20% of Americans admit social media influences their political
          views (Harvard)</li></ul>
    </ul>

  <!-- IDEA 2 -->
  <!-- Title -->
  <u><h2 style='font-size: 33px;'><em>Fireside Chats for the 21st Century</em></h2></u>
  <!-- Bullet Points Begin-->
  <ul style='font-family: sans-serif'>
    <li><u>Need:</u>
      <ul><li>
       Communication directors try to give as many voters as possible a personal connection
       to the candidate. For this reason, candidates do many town halls. The
       challenge with traditional town halls is that the candidate cannot be
       at multiple locations at once. </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><u>Idea:</u></li>
    <ul><li>
     <em>Every week at the same time, candidates or elected officials hold a Facebook live video
     in the following format: 5 minutes to share the three big goals or accomplishments of the week,
     and then 10-20 minutes to answer questions from their constituents. </em>These questions can be
     chosen in a poll among the community, or chosen at random from a constituent asking the question in
     a video. This idea has a few advantages. First, while a town hall reaches at
     most 100 people, Facebook live videos reach +1000 people. Second, by creating a regimented
     schedule and time length for the video, people will be more likely to watch. There is a
     reason TV shows happen at a predictable time, and some repeat similar segments like <em>The
     Daily Show.</em> Lastly, candidates can host these Facebook Live Townhalls
     in under 20-30 min at the comfort of their own home and office, which avoids the travel of traditional
     town halls. </li></ul>
    <li><u>Statistics:</u></li>
    <ul><li>
      Senator Tester did a Facebook live town hall in October 2018, and reached 13000 more
      viewers than any other video he did on Facebook in 2018. However, his Facebook Live
      town halls go on for a long period of time (50+ minutes), occur once a year,
      and happen at different times in the calendar. Imagine how
      many people would pay attention to a TV show that aired once a year, at a random time,
      for an unknown duration? Not many.

  <!-- IDEA 3 -->
  <!-- Title -->
  <u><h2 style='font-size: 33px;'><em>Gamifying Canvassing and Phone Calls</em></h2></u>
  <!-- Bullet Points Begin #3-->
  <ul style='font-family: sans-serif'>
    <li><u>Need:</u>
      <ul><li>
      Campaigns, and in particular field organizers, are always looking to
      wrangle a couple additional hours of work from their volunteers. Traditionally,
      volunteers do phone banking or canvassing. Volunteers are an essential
      part of the GOTV operation.
      </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><u>Idea:</u>
      <ul><li>
      <em> Implement the concepts used in addictive video games, as well as "Change.org"
        </em>. Every addictive video
      game gives a reward after a completed task. For people who do phone banking
      from home, give a reward to callers that chat with a certain number of people.
      The reward can be in the form of a video from the candidate, a free sticker, etc...
      Just like in any video game, make the reward easy to receive at first, but then
      progressively more difficult. From
      <a href="https://www.change.org/p/department-of-homeland-security-stop-tearing-families-apart">

      Change.org</a>,
       the site does a great job displaying
      a thermometer that represents how many people have joined each petition. Another idea could
      be campaigns creating such a thermometer to represent how many unique people have
      been contacted by the campaign. That way the work of one canvasser or one phone banker
      will push the thermometer closer to a given target, which in turn may inspire
      others to do even more phone banking or canvassing.

    <ul><li> A canvasser produces one more vote every 115 minutes. (Get Out the Vote
      by Donald Green and Alan Gerber, pg. 36) </li>
      <li> An activist who does phone banking produces one more vote every
      131 minutes. (Get Out the Vote by Donald Green and Alan Gerber, pg. 84)  </li>
